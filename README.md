# Find Blood Donor

This is an android application which helps users to find blood donor in their nearby locality.

## Why did you made this?
#### My project "Find Blood Donor" was built as per requirements of my community to help the people in need.I am glad as this project will be focusing in a socio-community level. As seen in different places and hosptals that many people remain in a pressure and in a obstacle during their treatment and surgery inorder to find blood which is required urgent. Within a certain perioud of time it is difficult to find blood as there are many examples that many patients loose their lives due to unavailability of blood in the required time.
#### Also there are different organizations,Ngo,clubs like Red cross, lions club which helps to proved blood to the patients but these ngo's suffer difficulty finding registered donors and also of required blood type. Therefore the donor's cant reach upto the patients.
#### Therefore, my app keeps data of all the donors in different plsce with their respective data and also the people in need of blood can directly request for blood due to which all donors and seekers can contact each other directly eliminating the involvment of various organizations and procedures which helps patients to get blood inside the required time frame.
